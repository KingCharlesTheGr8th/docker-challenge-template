<h1>Docker for Dummies</h1>
<p>Here is a simple guide to get you started with Docker.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Install Docker</h2>
<p>The first thing you'll want to do is install Docker. You can find the installation instructions on the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">official Docker website</a>.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Create a Dockerfile</h2>
<p>Next, you'll need to create a Dockerfile. This file will contain the instructions for building your Docker image.</p>
<p>The Dockcerfile should contain the following elements:</p>
<h3>FROM</h3>
<p>This is the base image that your image will be built on. You can find a list of available base images on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the software developer of the same name</p>
<h3>WORKDIR</h3>
<p>This sets the working directory for your image.</p>
<p>A cool directory to use is /app.</p>
<h3>COPY</h3>
<p>This copies files from your local machine into the image.</p>
<p>The COPY command supports basic glob patterns, so you can copy multiple files at once.</p>
<p>You can also use multiple COPY commands to copy multiple fiels if you're dumb.</p>
<h3>RUN</h3>
<p>This runs commands inside the image.</p>
<p>You can use RUN to install packages and such, but it won't help you run from your problems.</p>
<h3>EXPOSE</h3>
<p>This exposes a port on the image.</p>
<p>It's like opening a window to the outside world, but without the fresh air.</p>
<h3>CMD</h3>
<p>This sets the default command to run when the container starts.</p>
<p>I don't completely understand this one, but it seems important.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Build Your Image</h2>
<p>Now that you have your Dockerfile, you can build your image using the <code>docker build</code> command.</p>
<p>Don't forget to give your image a name using the <code>-t</code> flag.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Run Your Container</h2>
<p>Once your image is built, you can run a container using the <code>docker run</code> command.</p>
<p>Don't forget to map any ports you exposed in your Dokcerfile using the <code>-p</code> flag.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Profit</h2>
<p>That's it! You're now a Docker expert. Go forth and conquer the world.</p>
